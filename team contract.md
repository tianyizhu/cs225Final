# Team Contract

## Communication
**Team Meetings** 

We will have at least two meetings for each week on Wednesday and Saturday through Discord. Each meeting will last for about 1 or 2 hours and for every week we will rotate taking notes and recording minutes. We will save the notes in a Google doc, including the time and the topic of the meeting

**Assistance** 

We already made an agreement that we should contact each other on WeChat if anyone need help or opinion on a task. We are all able to respond other’s messages within an hour. 

**Respect** 

We decide to let the note taker to be the leader for that week’s work and meeting. During the meeting, we decided that each of us should talk about our own opinion or thoughts one by one for every topic about the final project. And we will have time to make a decision together after that to make sure everyone is actively involved and engaged. 

## Collaboration

**Work Distribution** 

In each meeting, we will decide the total necessary wordload for that week. Each member can select one or more tasks voluntarily. We will discuss the workload for each of the group members and try to balance the total tasks performed by each member.

**Time Commitment** 

We will discuss the approximate workload for the project each week by our progress, and divide all the tasks into balanced parts for the group members to choose. In estimate, each of the group members is expected to learn and work on the project for more than two to three hours and less than six or seven hours a week. The exact time commitment may change due to the progress but the ultimate goal is to get every member in the group to participate and contribute for the project. If some members are too many hours behind the estimate of the work on the project, it is the group's responsibility to communicate with them and find out a fair way to adjust the situation, including informing the instructor in some circumstances. 

**Conflict Resolution** 

We will hold a group meeting and discuss the possible solutions if there is a conflict in the group. If necessary, the group will reach out to the project mentor for help. The goal is to have a solution by voting. It is the group's responsibility to meet the majority's need.
